Features
--------

- display random XXX animations every minute
- display date

Build
-----

To generate the animations, 2 extra tools, outside Pebble's SDK, are needed.
- [rsvg-convert](https://github.com/GNOME/librsvg)
- [apngasm](https://github.com/apngasm/apngasm)

Notes
-----

- Pebble doesn't support the full apng specifications.
As a result, some of the animations generated by apngasm have some issues when being displayed.
Parts of a few frames are left drawn at the end of the sequence.
Current animations issues are not visible (black surface left on the black stripe).

- apngasm is doing some optimizations internally while building the sequence from frames.
For example, it detects that all frames are grayscale.
The resulting apng is then encoded in '8-bit grayscale' instead of '8-bit colormap'.
This is not supported by Pebble (failure to load the APNG during runtime).
It's not possible at the moment to disable those optimizations from the command line.
I have then been using my own hacked compiled version that remove this grayscale optimization.
(lib/src/apngasm.cpp, line 569, "int grayscale = 0;")
