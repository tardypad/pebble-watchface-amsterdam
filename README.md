![Basalt slide animation](/assets/basalt/animation_slide.gif?raw=true "Slide animation")

Features
--------

- display random XXX animations every minute
- display date

Build
-----

To generate the animations, 2 extra tools, outside Pebble's SDK, are needed.
- [convert](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)
- [gif2apng](http://gif2apng.sourceforge.net)
The generation of these animations is currently only possible on Linux.

Notes
-----

- Pebble doesn't support the full apng specifications.
As a result, some of the animations generated by gif2apng have some issues when being displayed.
Parts of a few frames are left drawn at the end of the sequence.
Current animations issues are not visible (black surface left on the black stripe).
